\section{CHANGES IN VERSION 0.8-4}{
  \subsection{NEW FEATURES}{
    \itemize{
      \item Uses a rejection sampler to simulated binary latent variables
      (CP Robert 2009, http://arxiv.org/pdf/0907.4010.pdf). Code thanks to
      Jared Murray.
    }
  }
  \subsection{USER-VISIBLE CHANGES}{
    \itemize{
      \item By default, no longer attempts to obtain identical results as
      BayesTree. To recover this behavior, compile from source with 
      \code{configure.args = "--enable-match-bayes-tree"}.
      \item Changing the entirety of the test matrix using \code{setTestPredictor}
      no longer allowed. Use \code{setTestPredictors} instead.
    }
  }
  \subsection{BUG FIXES}{
    \itemize{
      \item Corrected binary latent variable sampler and no longer multiply
      adds offset (reported by Jared Murray).
      \item Correct aggregation of results for multithreaded variance calculations.
      \item More equitably distributed tasks across multiple threads.
    }
  }
