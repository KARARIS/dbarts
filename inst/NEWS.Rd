\section{CHANGES IN VERSION 0.8-4}{
  \subsection{NEW FEATURES}{
    \itemize{
      \item Uses a rejection sampler to simulated binary latent variables
      (CP Robert 2009, http://arxiv.org/pdf/0907.4010.pdf). Code thanks to
      Jared Murray.
    }
  }
  \subsection{USER-VISIBLE CHANGES}{
    \itemize{
      \item By default, no longer attempts to obtain identical results as
      BayesTree. To recover this behavior, compile from source with 
      \code{configure.args = "--enable-match-bayes-tree"}.
    }
  }
  \subsection{BUG FIXES}{
    \itemize{
      \item Corrected binary latent variable sampler and no longer multiply
      adds offset (reported by Jared Murray).
    }
  }
